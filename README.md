# PH 3022: Machine Learning and Neural Computation

**University of Colombo - Faculty of Science** *Repository for Weekly Labs and Practical Assignments*

## 📌 Course Overview
This repository contains my coursework and weekly laboratory assignments for **PH 3022**, a comprehensive module on Machine Learning algorithms and Neural Computation.

The focus of this work is not just on implementation, but on understanding the mathematical foundations (gradient descent, backpropagation) and the practical challenges of data preprocessing, overfitting/underfitting, and model evaluation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
* **Deep Learning:** PyTorch / TensorFlow (Specify which one you use)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Retrospectives
*(Self-Reflection on major challenges)*

* **Handling Overfitting:** In Module 02, I learned that increasing model complexity doesn't always improve performance. Implementing L2 Regularization manually helped me visualize how it penalizes large weights.
* **The "Black Box" of NN:** Building a Neural Network from scratch (Module 07) before using frameworks was crucial for understanding how the Chain Rule propagates errors during the backward pass.
